There isn't much to say about this plugin. Just give it a try and find out ;)

After you activated the plugin you can access the plugin anywhere at any time you want.
Just place some of the following HTML code right there where you want the statistics displayed:
```
Now Online:  <js-counter-online></js-counter-online>
Last day:    <js-counter-day></js-counter-day>
Last week:   <js-counter-day7></js-counter-day7>
